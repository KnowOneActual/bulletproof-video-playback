- **4 files:** Core dashboard files (api.py, models.py, etc.)
- **31+:** Existing tests that will still pass
- **0:** Breaking changes to Phase 2.4

---

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Should I have Phase 2.4 fully working before starting?**  
A: Yes. Make sure all 31+ tests pass first. Phase 3.1 builds ON Phase 2.4.

**Q: Can I start today (Saturday)?**  
A: If you want! Read the docs, maybe do Day 1 setup. Most people start fresh Monday.

**Q: Do I need frontend experience?**  
A: Not much. We start with React via CDN (no build step), then move to TypeScript if wanted.

**Q: Will this work without ffmpeg?**  
A: Not for actual transcoding, but the UI will work. You'll see the system, just no real jobs.

**Q: Can I use Vue instead of React?**  
A: Absolutely! Same plan, different syntax. FastAPI backend stays identical.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Each day in QUICKSTART has troubleshooting. Worst case: ask for help, I'll code with you.
