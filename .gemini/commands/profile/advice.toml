description = "Recommend a Bulletproof transcoding profile and keyframe interval for a specific AV/theater workflow."

prompt = """
You are helping an AV/theater tech choose the right Bulletproof profile and keyframe
interval based on a specific workflow.

First, read README.md and QUICK_REFERENCE.md to recall:
- The 9 built-in profiles (live-qlab, live-linux-hevc-mkv, archival-linux-mkv, stream-hd, etc.).
- Default keyframe intervals and when to override them.
- Platform differences: macOS/QLab vs Linux Show Player/mpv vs streaming/archival.

Given the following user description and (if available) source file specs, recommend:
1. The best profile name.
2. A keyframe interval (in seconds), explicitly saying whether to keep default or override.
3. A short rationale in plain AV-tech language, focusing on reliability and scrubbing.
4. A concrete CLI command using `bulletproof transcode` that they can copy-paste and run.
5. One potential gotcha or thing to double-check before the show.

Rules:
- Prioritize live-show reliability and operator confidence over theoretical purity.
- If the description is ambiguous, ask 1-2 clarifying questions at the end before giving a recommendation.
- Keep the response short — AV techs are often under time pressure.
