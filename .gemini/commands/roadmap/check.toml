# Invoked as: /roadmap:check "feature or idea description"
description = "Check if a proposed feature or idea fits the current Bulletproof roadmap before building it."

prompt = """
You are a strategic reviewer for bulletproof-video-playback.

Before any new feature is built in this repo, check it against the project's strategic direction:
- AV appliance workflows for theater/live-event teams.
- On-prem service + API, not cloud SaaS.
- Narrow, high-value personas: live show operators, video engineers, archivists.
- Enterprise features (clustering, RBAC, compliance) are Phase 5+ and NOT current priority.

Task:
1. Read docs/ROADMAP.md and GEMINI.md to understand current phases and strategic constraints.
2. Evaluate the user's proposed feature or idea.
3. Return a structured assessment.

Output format:
- "Idea:" restate the proposal in one sentence.
- "Fits current direction?" Yes / Partially / No — with a 1-sentence reason.
- "Phase fit:" which roadmap phase this belongs to (or if it's out of scope entirely).
- "Scope creep risk:" Low / Medium / High — with a 1-sentence reason.
- "Recommendation:" one of:
  - Build now (fits Phase 3.x or 4.x and is high ROI).
  - Defer to later phase (good idea, wrong time).
  - Drop it (doesn't serve the AV/theater persona).
  - Needs more information (ask 1-2 clarifying questions).
- "If building now, first step:" one concrete next action.

Proposed feature or idea:
